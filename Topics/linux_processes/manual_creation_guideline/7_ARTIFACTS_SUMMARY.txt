## 🔥 Top 10 Most Useful Commands

1. **Monitor CPU:** `watch -n1 'awk "{print $14+$15}" /proc/$PID/stat'`
2. **Monitor memory:** `watch -n1 'awk "{printf \"%.1f MB\n\", $2*4/1024}" /proc/$PID/statm'`
3. **Find logs:** `readlink /proc/$PID/fd/1 /proc/$PID/fd/2`
4. **Check state:** `awk '{print "State: " $3}' /proc/$PID/stat`
5. **Check if zombie:** `ps aux | grep $PID | grep '<defunct>'`
6. **Get CPU time:** `awk '{printf "%.1f sec\n", ($14+$15)/100}' /proc/$PID/stat`
7. **Memory leak test:** Loop statm over 60 seconds, check for growth
8. **Find PID:** `systemctl show service -p MainPID | cut -d= -f2`
9. **List threads:** `ls /proc/$PID/task/ | wc -l`
10. **Check blocked:** `cat /proc/$PID/wchan`

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Every /proc/$pid/ File Tells a Story
- `stat` → What it's doing RIGHT NOW
- `fd/` → What files it's using
- `wchan` → Why it's blocked
- `statm` → How much memory
- `maps` → Memory layout

### 2. Systemd Simplifies Service Management
- Automatic restart on crash
- Resource limit control via cgroups
- Logging to journald
- Easy enable/disable at boot

### 3. You Can Diagnose Almost Any Issue
- Slow? Check `wchan`
- Memory leak? Check `smaps` over time
- Wrong log? Check `fd/`
- CPU spike? Check `sched`

### 4. Monitoring is Easy
- Just read /proc files
- No special tools needed
- Works on any Linux system
- Real-time visibility
