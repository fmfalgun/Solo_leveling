## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I complete all 15 projects?**  
A: No. Focus on high-priority projects (1-6) first. Complete 4-6 projects with excellence rather than 15 projects with mediocrity.

**Q: How much time per week do these require?**  
A: 25-35 hours/week for high-quality execution. This assumes you dedicate focused time.

**Q: Should projects be open-source?**  
A: Ideally yes for 80% of projects. This builds your portfolio and attracts recruiter attention.

**Q: Can I do these while working full-time?**  
A: Yes, but expect 15-20 month completion timeline for 4-6 projects. Plan accordingly.

**Q: Which project should I start with?**  
A: Project 1 (ML-IDS) or Project 5 (SPIRE). Both leverage existing skills and can be completed in 2-3 months.

**Q: How do I present these in interviews?**  
A: Walk through problem statement → technical approach → specific tools/technologies → quantifiable results → lessons learned.
