# Project 6: OT/ICS Security - Executive Summary & Business Case
## Market Opportunity, Career Impact & Industrial Security Advantage Analysis

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Name:** OT/ICS Security Assessment Platform  
**Duration:** 3-4 months (360-480 hours)  
**Complexity:** HIGH  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (Phase 2 project)  
**Target Market Value:** $50K-$1M per consulting engagement

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project 6 addresses a critical blind spot: only 20% of industrial facilities have dedicated operational technology (OT) security. Unlike IT security (which has saturated markets and intense competition), OT security expertise is **rare, highly valuable, and commands premium pricing**.

Your unique combination of **engineering thinking** (from cybersecurity background) + **security expertise** = rare OT/ICS security specialist (potential 2-3 year head start vs competitors).
