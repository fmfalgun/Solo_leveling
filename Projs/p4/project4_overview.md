# Project 4: Red Team AWS Penetration Testing Toolkit
## Complete Offensive Security Framework for Cloud Attack Surface Assessment

**Project Duration:** 3-4 months | **Complexity:** MEDIUM | **Priority:** 🔴 HIGH
**Target Deliverables:** Production-grade AWS penetration testing toolkit with automated exploitation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project Objective:** Develop a comprehensive red team penetration testing toolkit specifically designed for AWS cloud infrastructure, enabling systematic discovery, exploitation, and reporting of cloud security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✓ AWS-specific attack vectors (IAM, S3, EC2, Lambda, RDS, API Gateway)
- ✓ Automated exploitation framework (no manual testing required)
- ✓ Multi-account AWS environment support
- ✓ Compliance-aware testing (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
- ✓ Publication-ready research documentation
- ✓ Consulting leverage ($50K-$200K+ per engagement)
- ✓ Direct appeal to Amazon, Google Cloud, Meta roles
