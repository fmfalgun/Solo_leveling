# Project 5: Threat Hunting AI - Executive Summary & Business Case
## Market Opportunity, Career Impact & Consulting Leverage Value Analysis

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Project Name:** AI-Powered Threat Hunting & Anomaly Detection Framework  
**Duration:** 2-3 months (300-360 hours)  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (Phase 2 project)  
**Target Market Value:** $30K-$100K+ per consulting engagement

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project 5 leverages your existing **CDAC attack datasets** to build a production-grade threat hunting platform that automates security investigations. Unlike traditional SIEM rules (static), this system uses **machine learning** to discover novel threats that attackers deliberately craft to evade known detections.

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✓ Directly uses your CDAC datasets (you already have the data!)
- ✓ ML-based (discovers unknown attack patterns)
- ✓ MITRE ATT&CK integrated (contextualizes threats)
- ✓ Hypothesis-driven (scalable threat hunting)
- ✓ Production-ready API & dashboards
- ✓ Consulting pathway ($30K-$100K per engagement)
- ✓ Career leverage (analyst → senior engineer roles)
