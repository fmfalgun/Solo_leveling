Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

My Answer: pointers start with * stores address of some variable
	whereas references refer to the address pointers saves.

gpt answer: 

Pointers and references are both used to indirectly access objects in C++, but they differ in behavior, flexibility, and typical use cases.

1. Definition and Initialization

Pointer: A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another object.
It can be declared without initialization and later assigned an address.

Reference: A reference is an alias (another name) for an existing object.
It must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot exist without referring to an object.

2. Rebinding Capability

Pointer: Can be reassigned to point to different objects during its lifetime.

Reference: Once bound to an object, it cannot be rebound to refer to another object.

3. Nullability

Pointer: Can be set to nullptr, meaning it points to no object.

Reference: Cannot be null; it must always refer to a valid object.

4. Access Syntax

Pointer: Requires explicit dereferencing (*) to access the object it points to.

Reference: Accessed just like a normal variable; no dereferencing syntax is needed.

5. Level of Indirection

Pointer: Is an object itself with its own memory address and size.

Reference: Is not a separate object; it acts as an alternative name for the original object.

6. Typical Use Cases

Pointers:

Dynamic memory management

Data structures (linked lists, trees)

Optional ownership (nullptr allowed)

References:

Function parameters and return values

Enforcing non-null, always-valid access

Cleaner and safer syntax

Summary Table
Feature	Pointer	Reference
Initialization	Optional	Mandatory
Can be null	Yes (nullptr)	No
Rebinding allowed	Yes	No
Syntax to access	*ptr	Direct variable access
Separate object	Yes	No (alias only)

In short:
Use pointers when you need flexibility (reassignment, nullability).
Use references when you want safer, cleaner access to an existing object that must always be valid.
