Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
	(a) int i = -1, &r = 0; 
	(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
	(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0; 
	(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
	(e) const int *p1 = &i2; 
	(f) const int &const r2;
	(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;

My answer: 
	a - i allowed coz int can be negative, but address can't be zero
	b - correct pointer constantly pointing to same location
	c - i allowes coz constant int can be negative but address can't be zero
	d - illegal, what is const int const* ?!
	e - legal, pointer contant pointing to integer
	f - illegal, what is const int &const ?!
	g - legal, contant pointers were initialized

	| Item | Legal? | Reason                                        |
	| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
	| (a)  | ❌      | Non-const reference to literal                |
	| (b)  | ✅      | Const pointer initialized correctly           |
	| (c)  | ✅      | Const reference can bind to literal           |
	| (d)  | ✅      | Const pointer to const int                    |
	| (e)  | ✅      | Pointer to const int                          |
	| (f)  | ❌      | References can’t be `const` & must initialize |
	| (g)  | ❌      | Non-const reference to const object           |
